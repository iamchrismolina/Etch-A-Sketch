# Etch-A-Sketch

This Etch-A-Sketch is a Web-App where you can unleash your creativity & imagination and express it to the board. This web-app is a virtual representation of the real life etch-a-sketch toy.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML CSS JavaScript

HTML: I setup the container and the buttons (rainbow, setGrid, & reset/black, clear). I then assigned them IDs and Class-names that fit. Class-names were mostly used for CSS to be styled and IDs are for javascript functionality.

CSS: I setup the size of the container and create a default square/pixel size, which will be used to assign a new pixel once created. Then added some background-color and proper layouting of the page.

JS: I add/change the behavior of the elements depending on which button is clicked, which is made possible through event listeners. I added a clear & reset button to erase the board. Also, setting up the size of the grid is possible by inputting numbers between 2 to 100 and adjust the board size based on those. Lastly, rainbow button is added which basically just uses 'Math.random()' on the rgb values.

## Optimizations:

The design can be enhanced further to make it more alluring and modern. Functionalities that you like can be added like more control on the colors or adding an eraser.

## Lessons Learned:

I have learned about DOM manipulations where you change/add/remove the properties of HTML & CSS indirectly just through JavaScript. Using addEventListeners & selecting HTML elements through their IDs to change how they behave is very fascinating and insightful/eye-opening to me.
